                <p>
                    The rivalry between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates is known as a cultural element of the sector.<br>
                    Steve Jobs' relationship with Bill Gates was somewhat balanced on rivalry and friendship.
                    Both signed multi-million-dollar deals as in the case that shortly after Jobs returned to Apple, 
                    he agreed with Microsoft to create a Microsoft Office suite for Mac. 
                    And when Apple, after the launch of the world's most famous music player, the iPod, 
                    made its advanced music service, iTunes, available to the Microsoft operating system.<br>
                    In the authorized biography of Jobs, Walter Isaacson recounts an encounter between Steve and Bill. 
                    Steve Jobs was too weak to get out of bed, due to the cancer that was belatedly treated, 
                    when he received a visit from Bill Gates. 
                    Both spent a lot of time talking about their families and their lives. 
                    The visit took place shortly before the death of the Apple co-founder in 2011.
